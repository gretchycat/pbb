              Portable Behavioral Blueprint (PBB) Specification
                          Version 1.0 â€” Draft 0.1


Abstract

   The Portable Behavioral Blueprint (PBB) defines an extensible XML-
   based schema for representing persistent, ethically constrained user
   or AI personality profiles.  It enables systems to share information
   such as identity, interests, cognition, health, social context, and
   provenance while maintaining modularity, privacy, and traceability.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

1.  Introduction

   The Portable Behavioral Blueprint (PBB) is a framework for encoding
   complex user or AI identities as structured, extensible XML
   documents. It supports incremental refinement ("living documents"),
   selective sharing, and provenance tracking across distributed systems.

2.  Goals

   o  Support incremental, organic evolution of profiles
   o  Permit partial export/import of subprofiles
   o  Maintain validation while remaining flexible
   o  Include verifiable provenance metadata
   o  Enable consent-based persistence across AIs

3.  Terminology and Namespaces

4.  Core Schema

   The core defines <personality_profile> as the root element containing:
   - metadata
   - identity
   - an open wildcard for extension elements.

   Every element is optional except for the version attribute.

5.  Extension Model

   Extensions are imported modularly using XML Schema (XSD) with their
   own namespaces. Each defines a focused data domain (e.g., health,
   interests, personality). Wildcards ensure future-proof extensibility.

6.  Data Sections (Informative)

   6.1. Identity
        Optional demographic or descriptive information.

   6.2. Interests
        Defines hobbies and passions. The Music schema is a reference model.

   6.3. Personality
        Encapsulates cognitive style, values, and philosophical orientation.

   6.4. Health
        Describes conditions, treatments, and self-reported well-being.

   6.5. Social
        Covers relationships, affiliations, and communities.

   6.6. Provenance
        Tracks origin, edit history, and validation integrity.

7.  Provenance and Versioning

   Profiles SHOULD include a <provenance> section to track origin and
   modification events. Checksums and signatures MAY be provided to
   ensure verifiability and cross-system integrity.

8.  Privacy and Ethical Guidelines

   o  All elements are optional.
   o  Systems MUST honor consent and purpose limitation.
   o  Pseudonymous identifiers are valid.
   o  Profiles MAY be partitioned and selectively shared.

9.  Security Considerations

   Profiles can include sensitive data. Implementations SHOULD encrypt
   in transit and at rest, and validate signatures prior to use.

10. Future Work

   o  JSON-LD mapping and RDF ontology definitions.
   o  Schema manifest for automatic module discovery.
   o  Conformance suite for interoperability testing.
